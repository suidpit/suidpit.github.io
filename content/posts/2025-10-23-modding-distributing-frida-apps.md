For a side-project of mine, I recently faced the challenge of modding an application with `frida`, and then distribute the modded application to a couple friends.

Now, using frida in its *no-bs* mode, that is, a host machine plugged via USB to a rooted phone, is simple and very widely documented in the internet. However, `frida`¬†also supports autonomous script execution, which is ideal for mods.

This mode of operation is, alas, less used and documented. Moreover, the little documentation that exists leaves a lot to be desired, and with the advent of Frida 17 (which introduced important changes), is now oftentimes wrong.

In this blogpost I'm going to walk through a workflow that should work for your modding quests.

## The Lab

For this experiment, let's take a simple app and a simple mod.

The app picked for this experiment is [Dicer](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer/) . It's an app to, well, roll dice.

Now, about the mod...if there's one thing we want from an app that rolls dice, is controlling the result predictably, right?

So yeah, it's exactly what you would expect: **we're going to mod the app so that we always get ONE, no matter how many times we roll**.

## Create the Agent

As mentioned above, since Frida 17, bridges are not part of the of the GumJS runtime anymore, which means that bridges need to be pulled in the agent just like every other package we would need to use.

The `frida-tools`¬†package contains a useful script to scaffold a new frida agent:

```
‚ùØ frida-create -t agent -o mod
Created mod/package.json
Created mod/tsconfig.json
Created mod/agent/index.ts
Created mod/agent/logger.ts
Created mod/.gitignore

Run `npm install` to bootstrap, then:
- Keep one terminal running: npm run watch
- Inject agent using the REPL: frida Calculator -l _agent.js
- Edit agent/*.ts - REPL will live-reload on save

Tip: Use an editor like Visual Studio Code for code completion, inline docs,
     instant type-checking feedback, refactoring tools, etc.
```

This commands creates a new typescript project, configured with all the correct switches and scripts that make compiling frida agents as easy as running `npm run build`.

Time to write the mod.

## Mod Development

My intention is to keep this blogpost short, so I will not delve into frida development or Android reverse engineering. So here's the full code of the mod:

```typescript
import Java from "frida-java-bridge";

Java.perform(function () {
  var dicer = Java.use("org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.dicer.Dicer");

  dicer.rollDice.implementation = function (numDice: number, numFaces: number) {
    return Array(numDice).fill(1);
  };
});
```

In order to compile this mod, we first need to pull the bridge package:

`npm install frida-java-bridge`

And then we can compile things with:

`npm run build`

The npm script simply calls `frida-compile` with the correct arguments (you can inspect them in the `package.json` file).

Before moving on to the distribution part, it's important to test the mod. That can be done by invoking the app with frida, loading the script:

`frida -U -f org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer -l _agent.js`

Which shows that, no matter what, we now really suck at this game:

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/suidpit/images@master/uPic/image-20251023130139530.png" style="zoom:40%"/>



Ok, mod has been confirmed, we can continue with distribution.

## Mod Distribution

One of the *frida essentials* is that frida must inject an agent in the target process in order to do its magic. How frida does so depends on its [mode of operation](https://frida.re/docs/modes/):  when a `frida-server` is running on the device, the `frida-tools`¬†such as the REPL or `frida-trace` can contact the server, either via USB or network, and the server takes care of injecting the agent into a running process ‚Äì or spawning it in the first place.

But this is not the only way!

In fact, the `frida-gadget` ‚Äì which is essentially a dynamic library, AKA an `.so` file in Android¬†‚Äì can be directly embedded into the app. This way, we can use frida in jailed/unrooted devices where running the privileged `frida-server` is not feasible. But there's also another important advantage: in its *gadget embedding* mode, frida provides autonomous script execution, which means that the app loads and executes the agent without any interaction from outside tooling. And this is exactly what we want to use for mod distribution.

### Easy Patching via Objection

There are some steps involved with embedding the `frida-gadget` library and configuring it for autonomous script execution. Luckily, we can use the good old [objection](https://github.com/sensepost/objection) suite to automate the workflow.

First, we compile again the agent, in its root directory:

```
‚ùØ npm run build

> dice-agent@1.0.0 build
> frida-compile agent/index.ts -o _agent.js -c
```

Then, we need to create the `frida-gadget` configuration file. For autonomous script execution, the configuration should have the following content:

```json
{
  "interaction": {
    "type": "script",
    "path": "libfrida-gadget.script.so"
  }
}
```

We will name this file `gadget-config.json`.

Time to let `objection` do its magic:

```

After running the command, you should see a file named `<original_apk_name>.objection.apk` in the current directory. That's the modded APK!

We can now confirm that the modded app works by uninstalling the original app, reinstalling the modded APK, unplugging the USB cable from the phone, running the app and notice that we still suck at throwing dice üöÄüöÄüöÄ

### (NOTES FOR SPLIT APKs)

In case your target app is made of multiple (split) APKs, the tool should always be launched against the base APK, that is, the one that contains the `MainActivity` of the application.

Moreover, once the modded APK has been produced, you will need to sign the other split APKs with the same key that `objection` used. You can use `objection signapk apk1, apk2, ...` for this.

Last but not least, the split APKs must be installed together. You can do this via `adb install-multiple apk1, apk2, ...`, but this isn't great for distribution, right? Much better to merge the split APKs into a single one via https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor.

## Bonus - How The Sausage Is Made

Depending on tools is all good and allows for quick mod developments, but what if things break? In this bonus section, I'll peek into the `objection` magic.

The first step is to extract both the APKs (the original and the modded):

```
‚ùØ apktool d org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.apk
I: Using Apktool 2.10.0 on org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.apk with 8 thread(s).
I: Baksmaling classes.dex...

‚ùØ apktool d org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection.apk
I: Using Apktool 2.10.0 on org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection.apk with 8 thread(s).

I: Copying unknown files...
I: Copying original files...
I: Copying META-INF/services directory
```

We can resort to a simple diff to see what changed:

` diff -r org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection`

The output of this command is quite large and contains a lot of unimportant changes. However, we can quickly spot the important parts:

### android.permission.INTERNET

```
diff --color -r org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer/AndroidManifest.xml org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection/AndroidManifest.xml
33a34
>     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

`objection` patched the Android manifest to include the `INTERNET` permission. This is needed in case we needed to run the `frida-gadget` in listen mode, to allow connections from the `frida-tools`. We don't actually need this for our mode of operation.

### `lib`¬†directory

```
Only in org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection: lib
```

A new directory was added to the modded apk:

```
‚ùØ tree lib
lib
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ arm64-v8a
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libfrida-gadget.config.so
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libfrida-gadget.script.so
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libfrida-gadget.so

2 directories, 3 files
```

These are, respectively:

- The `frida-gadget` configuration.
- The agent.
- The `frida-gadget`¬†library itself.

Essentially, `objection` is adding a new native library to the APK, and it's setting up the autonomous agent and the configuration just where `frida` expects them to be.

### Library Loading

```
diff --color -r org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer/smali/org/secuso/privacyfriendlydicer/ui/SplashActivity.smali org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.objection/smali/org/secuso/privacyfriendlydicer/ui/SplashActivity.smali
6a7,17
> .method static constructor <clinit>()V
>     .locals 1
>
>     .prologue
>     const-string v0, "frida-gadget"
>
>     invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V
>
>     return-void
> .end method
>
```

This is `smali` assembly that implements the `System.loadLibrary("frida-gadget")` method call. The latter loads the `frida-gadget` library that lives in the `lib` directory.

The `.method static constructor <clinit>()V`¬†line defines a **static constructor** for the class, so that it will run a single time, when the `SplashActivity` class is first loaded by the Dalvik VM.

As expected, the activity we're injecting is the main activity of the application, that is, the one that is created and called when the application spawns. We can verify this by inspecting the Android manifest:

```xml
<activity android:exported="true" android:name="org.secuso.privacyfriendlydicer.ui.SplashActivity" android:theme="@style/SplashTheme">
  <intent-filter>
      <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
      <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

## Conclusions

It happened to me more than once that I wanted to package and distribute applications modded with `frida`. It made sense to write a blogpost, so that I can store this workflow somewhere, and maybe others can find it useful, too.

Happy hacking!
